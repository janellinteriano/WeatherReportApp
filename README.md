<h1>Weather Reporting App</h1>
<p>This application gives the user a simple weather report showing the current weather conditions such as the current temperature, wind speeds and humidity percentage. This app uses a free weather api from Openweathermap.org.
Vanilla Javascript is used to fetch the data from the api depending on what city is passed through the api url. Different elements of the app are changed based on the chosen city's weather condition. For example, if it is raining in a city such as New York or Seattle,
the background color of the whole div will change to the css color "dim grey". The image of the cloud condition will also change at the top center of the app. This app will still be a work in progress to add more features such as a search bar and possibly a full week weather report.</p>
